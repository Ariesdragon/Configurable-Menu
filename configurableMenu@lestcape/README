"Configurable Menu is a fork of the Cinnamon stock menu applet. It has much more features and is extremely configurable."

This latest version brings a lot of cool new stuff.

2.	You can define the exact size of the menu (width and height) using the menu settings.

3.	Now you can also resize the menu by dragging a resize handle (on the menu corner) with the mouse!

4.	You can choose among many different menu layouts.

5.	You can choose among many different system buttons layouts.

6.	The menu can show a magnified picture of the icon which is being hovered, similarly to the Windows 7 start menu.

7.	You can show/hide favorites, hover icon, system buttons, control buttons, data/time, separators etc...

8.	You can separate the system buttons from the favorites.

9.	You have two different modes of viewing the application entries: List View and Grid View.

10.	List View can have multiple columns.

11.	You can have favorites with multiple lines (rows or columns).

12.	You can drag & drop menu items onto the desktop.
