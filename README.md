And much more coming...

This applet not longer has support for Arch Linux.
--------------
The comunity of Arch Linux do not want that I or other Cinnamon developer, publish about Cinnamon, and receive the users feedback (necessary on the developing any app). When the comunity of Arch Linux, want to be open to the free software world, sure that I want to support Arch Linux again...

Cinnamon Installer
--------------
Configurable Menu is a applet of the Cinnamon desktop. This desktop can be installed on different Linux distributions and therefore managing the packages that Configurable Menu makes, needs the help of the Cinnamon Installer tool.

The main objective of Cinnamon Installer is that it may be implemented in most of the distributions. However this is far from happening for now. Any help will be well received.

You can found more information about Cinnamon Installer on the [Cinnamon Installer website](https://github.com/lestcape/Cinnamon-Installer).
